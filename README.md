## Data

### Data Source

Credits to [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) for providing this data. Data are processed from the following file:

* listings.csv: information regarding the listed properties and its respective host
* calendar.csv: availability and price of each listing on particular day from late December 2024 to December 2025
* reviews.csv: reviews given by user toward each listing

### Data Preprocessing

* Listing data are split into 3 separate table:

  * host : all information regarding the host (some hosts can have multiple listings)
  * amenities: all amenities or service provided by the listing
  * listing: all information regarding the listed properties

* Calendar data  are kept as a single table with some cleansing process, including converting the `price` into numeric and `availability` as logical

* Reviews data are split into 2 separate table:

  * user: information regarding the user  
  * review: Reviews data are further processed by adding sentiment flagging column to indicate if a review has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using [Twitter Roberta](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base) model.

All processed data are compiled together into [sqlite table](https://github.com/Argaadya/airbnb_market_performance/tree/main/data)
